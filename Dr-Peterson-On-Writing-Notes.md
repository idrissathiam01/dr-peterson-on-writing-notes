### WHILE READING:
	-Notice anything that catches your attention
	-Try not to cop down notes word for word.  Summarize and give the audiobook timestamp or page number.
		Ask yourself:  What did the excerpt mean?

### Create Outline:  
	-1 sentence for every 100 words (1 paragraph) NOTE: It is okay to use two paragraphs to address a single idea.

### What is the question you are seeking to answer? (Ask the LORD)

### Thought Process
	-words =  feelings, moods, adjectives
	-sentences = thoughts, anecdotes, summaries, excerpts, facts
	-paragraphs = ideas, assertions

### WRITING PROCESS
	1. Write your paragraphs
	2. Establish your logic and reorder paragraphs
	3. Edit your paragraphs as parts of the whole essay
		-When editing place each sentence on its own line and rewrite each sentence.
		-add transitions and flair
		-Be as consise and brief as possible
		-When finished, reread your essay and reconstruct your outline from memory.
	4. Consider your audience and the larger context and add flair into appropriate spots

### SOMEHING IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN NOTHING.
